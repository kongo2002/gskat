gskat - an open-source gtk skat game
http://github.com/kongo2002/gskat

ABOUT

gskat allows you to play Skat against two computer controlled players.
Since gskat is currently in beta state you cannot expect too much AI
from the computer opponents.  Nevertheless they strictly follow the
rules, do not cheat and act on some major game playing principles.

There are many web resources for learning to play Skat.  A good starting
point is probably the Wikipedia:

INSTALL

All installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file shipped
with the package. But to put it in a nutshell, just do something like
the following (after unpacking the archive):

    cd gskat
    ./configure
    make && sudo make install

Your feedback, bug reports and ideas for new features are especially
welcome.
