gskat is a gtk skat game written in c

The current state cannot even be considered as alpha stadium because it
is not playable. The main reason for me to program gskat is to improve
my c skills and to become familiar with glib/gtk.

So maybe in the future this small game will be playable but until then
it is a long way to go.
