gskat - an open-source gtk skat game
http://github.com/kongo2002/gskat

ABOUT

gskat allows you to play Skat against two computer controlled players.
Since gskat is currently in alpha state you cannot expect too much AI
from the computer opponents.  Nevertheless they strictly follow the
rules, do not cheat and act on some major game playing principles.

There are many web resources for learning to play Skat.  A good starting
point is probably the Wikipedia:

    see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game)

INSTALL

Currently there is only a simple Makefile assisting you to install
gskat.  So after downloading the source files you simply do:

    cd gskat
    make

After compiling the game can be started by launching the executable:

    ./gskat

Your feedback, bug reports and ideas for new features are especially
welcome.
