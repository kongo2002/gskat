* AI: properly implement 'null' and 'grand' games
* AI: improve bidding algorithm
* AI: implement different AI difficulty levels
  (i.e. easy, medium, hard, [cheater])
* save and view round/stich history
* implement 'ramsch' game
* implement 'bock' rounds
* implement a tournament mode (i.e. play a configurable number of rounds)
* review last trick(s)                                                      DONE
* add localization/language support                                         DONE
* save and load game and round states                                       DONE
* implement integrated bug reports                                          DONE

MINOR POINTS

* show point distribution graph dialog
* integrate optional pre-round random seed definition for card
  distribution
* add an option to automatically begin the next trick (i.e. timeout)
* add tooltips to GUI elements
* show a detailled score resolution at the end of a round
* make game rule 'play with spitzen' configurable
* implement a game mode (+ configuration option) for the official Skat
  Order (standard rules of D.S.K.V. and I.S.P.A.)
* bug reports should work in loaded games as well
  (i.e. save bug report log in game state)
* slow down bidding process between computer players                        DONE
* use XDG base directory specification for config/data files                DONE
* improve game summary display                                              DONE
* connect review of played trick(s) with a configuration rule/setting       DONE
* rewrite/update configuration if the old config is not valid               DONE
* improve card movement animation                                           DONE
* change the mouse cursor shape depending on the cursor position            DONE
  (valid card, non-valid card, table ...)                                   DONE
* design and implement a game icon                                          DONE

IMPROVEMENTS

* rewrite AI concept/implementation (more flexible, dynamic)
* write some basic unit test routines
* add a checksum to saved/loaded round states
* use autotools for compile/install                                         DONE
* move from Doxygen to GtkDoc for documentation                             DONE
* write an ebuild for Gentoo Linux                                          DONE
* rewrite debug/log/print functionality (i.e. log levels)                   DONE

MAYBE

* implement network/multiplayer mode
* implement a database (sqlite?) backend for statistics
